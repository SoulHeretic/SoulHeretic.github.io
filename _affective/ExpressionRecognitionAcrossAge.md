title: "1. II-New: A Research Platform for Heterogeneous, Massive Parallel Computing"
collection:
---

  The aim of this project is to build a new computing research infrastructure that will accelerate existing research and enable ground-breaking new research that shares the common theme of massive parallel computing at USF. The requested infrastructure is a computer cluster with about 120 many-core co-processors including GPUs and Intel Phi cards. This acquisition will provide the much needed parallel computing capacity that is currently lacking in the existing USF IT infrastructure. This project will bring together eight investigators with research projects in several core disciplines of computer science and engineering: big data management, scientific computing, system security, hardware design, data mining, computer vision and pattern recognition. The proposed new resource will enable or enhance research in design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel programs at various levels of the software stack, ranging from cluster-level systems to individual application components and domain-specific languages. The infrastructure will also enhance learning experience of students as well as course content, curriculum development, and laboratory environment. The team of investigators will form a "USF Parallel Computing Workgroup" to coordinate related research, education, and outreach activities. This ensures the project team act in an integrated way to maximize the impact of the new infrastructure on the entire USF community.

title: "2. G-SDMS: A High-Throughput Scientific Data Management System"
collection:

  Many scientific domains have entered a data-driven era, in which scientific discovery depends heavily on effective and efficient analysis of large-scale data generated by wet-bench experiments or computer simulations. Current database management systems (DBMSs), while being very popular in the business world, fall short in high-throughput data processing required by scientific applications. The goal of this project is to design and implement a novel data management software architecture that enables high-throughput data management services for general scientific communities. The project achieves this goal via (1) a novel one-scan-fits-all data processing framework based on repetitive scans of large data sources; (2) a query engine that leverages the massive computing power of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPU) hardware; and (3) design and implementation of algorithms for popular analytics in three scientific domains on top of the query engine to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture. The project also aims at building a software prototype and evaluating this prototype with real-world scientific datasets and query workloads. The project is expected to provide a highly efficient solution to satisfy the data management needs of a wide range of scientific fields. To deliver comparable performance, the proposed architecture requires only a fraction of the hardware and energy costs needed by existing systems. As a result, it will make scientific studies that are regarded as difficult or infeasible a reality. The proposed research will be integrated into educational endeavors that contribute to broadening the influence of computer science, nurturing the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists, and boosting the success of minority and women students in the computer science and engineering field.
