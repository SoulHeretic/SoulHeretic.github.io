# Abstract
In this work, we propose to use 3D facial landmarks for the task of subject identification, over a range of expressed emotion. Landmarks are detected, using a Temporal Deformable Shape Model and used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network for subject identification. As we are interested in subject identification with large variations in expression, we conducted experiments on 3 emotion-based databases, namely the BU-4DFE, BP4D, and BP4D+ 3D/4D face databases. We show that our proposed method outperforms current state of the art methods for subject identification on BU-4DFE and BP4D. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate subject identification on the BP4D+, resulting in a baseline for the community.
