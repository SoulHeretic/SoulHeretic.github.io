# Abstract
  The aim of this project is to build a new computing research infrastructure that will accelerate existing research and enable ground-breaking new research that shares the common theme of massive parallel computing at USF. The requested infrastructure is a computer cluster with about 120 many-core co-processors including GPUs and Intel Phi cards. This acquisition will provide the much needed parallel computing capacity that is currently lacking in the existing USF IT infrastructure. This project will bring together eight investigators with research projects in several core disciplines of computer science and engineering: big data management, scientific computing, system security, hardware design, data mining, computer vision and pattern recognition. The proposed new resource will enable or enhance research in design, implementation, and evaluation of parallel programs at various levels of the software stack, ranging from cluster-level systems to individual application components and domain-specific languages. The infrastructure will also enhance learning experience of students as well as course content, curriculum development, and laboratory environment. The team of investigators will form a "USF Parallel Computing Workgroup" to coordinate related research, education, and outreach activities. This ensures the project team act in an integrated way to maximize the impact of the new infrastructure on the entire USF community.
    This project is supported by an [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/) CRI award ([CNS-1513126](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1513126)).
