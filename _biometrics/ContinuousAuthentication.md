  The continuous feature of both data and queries in data stream management systems (DSMSs) place great demand on system resources. However, queries can be processed with different levels of quality such as timeliness, reliability, and uncertainty. In this project, we study the problem of how to maintain tuple processing delays in query processing in DSMSs. A widely-used approach to maintain QoS (especially tuple delays) in DSMS query processing is load shedding, i.e., dropping data. Current load shedding solutions utilize simple, intuitive ideas in determining the time and amount of load to be discarded and do not work well in the presence of system/environmental disturbances. We propose a solution based on feedback control theory with significantly improved long-term performance. Currently, we are exploring the strategy of semantic load shedding: selectively shedding data according to their importance to the query results.

# 2. QuaSAQ: Enabling End-to-End QoS by A Database-Centric Approach.

  Support of user-input QoS requirements in multimedia databases cannot be accomplished by simply deploying the multimedia DBMS on top of QoS-provisioning OS or middleware. We propose an integrated QoS-control framework (QuaSAQ) as part of the DBMS as well as cost models to evaluate the QoS-aware queries. QuaSAQ is implemented on the basis of our video DBMS - [VDBMS](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/vdbms/).

# 3. Hybrid Peer-to-Peer Media Streaming System. [[link]](https://cse.usf.edu/~tuy/research/P2P/index1.html)

  Peer-to-peer networks provide a method to solve the scalability problem of traditional server-based media streaming services. We studied the capacity (bandwidth) growth of such systems by performing quantitative analysis of a generic P2P streaming model.

# 4. VDBMS - A video DBMS. [[link]](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/vdbms/)

  A multimedia DBMS with full-featured video processing and content-based retrieval capabilities. I investigated the use of tertiary storage as medium for active data. One of the most serious problems in using tertiary storage is long response time to requests. I also studied relevant caching and pre-fetching algorithms for the purpose of minimizing latency.
