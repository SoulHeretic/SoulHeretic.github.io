title: "Counting frequent patterns in large labeled graphs: a hypergraph-based approach"
excerpt: "We propose a new framework for studying support measures in frequent subgraph mining. This framework transforms pattern and data graph into hypergraphs containing occurrences and instances of the pattern as well as information of the original graph, in contrast to existing overlap graph techniques that only contain the former."
