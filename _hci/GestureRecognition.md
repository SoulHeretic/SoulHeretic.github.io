# Abstract
In this paper, we propose an approach, for sign language recognition, that makes use of a virtual
reality headset to create an immersive environment. We show how features from data acquired by
the Leap Motion controller, using an egocentric view, can be used to automatically recognize a user
signed gesture. The Leap features are used along with a random forest for real-time classification of
the userâ€™s gesture. We further analyze which of these features are most important, in an egocentric
view, for gesture recognition. To test the efficacy of our proposed approach, we test on the 26 letters of the alphabet in American Sign Language in a virtual environment with an application for learning
sign language
