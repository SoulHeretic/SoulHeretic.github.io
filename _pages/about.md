I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of South Florida, as well as a member of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition group. My research interests are broadly in computer vision, pattern recognition, and image processing. More specifically, I am interested in Affective Computing, Biometrics, Machine Learning, Multimodal Signal Processing, and Human-Computer Interaction.
