title: "Eficient Join Algorithms For Large Database Tables in a Multi-GPU Environment"
excerpt: "We designed three join algorithms with diferent out-of-core data transfer patterns and the same in-core join processing. By a series of experiments, we demonstrated that the inter-GPU communication and data exchange drastically afect the running time of the join algorithms."
