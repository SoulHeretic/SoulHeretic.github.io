I'm a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of South Florida. My research interests are in the areas of database systems, distributed systems, and high performance computing. I attended graduate school at Purdue University, and got a PhD and an MS in Computer Sciences. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Horticulture from China Agricultural University.

# ["Eficient Join Algorithms For Large Database Tables in a Multi-GPU Environment"](/files/DrTuPaper1.pdf)
We designed three join algorithms with diferent out-of-core data transfer patterns and the same in-core join processing. By a series of experiments, we demonstrated that the inter-GPU communication and data exchange drastically afect the running time of the join algorithms.



Multiple positions are available for undergraduate students. If you are an undergraduate student interested in doing research and gaining some hands-on experience on database management systems, feel free to talk to me. And you will get paid!
