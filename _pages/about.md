I'm a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of South Florida. My research interests are in the areas of database systems, distributed systems, and high performance computing. I attended graduate school at Purdue University, and got a PhD and an MS in Computer Sciences. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Horticulture from China Agricultural University.

# [Eficient Join Algorithms For Large Database Tables in a Multi-GPU Environment](/files/DrTuPaper1.pdf)
We designed three join algorithms with diferent out-of-core data transfer patterns and the same in-core join processing. By a series of experiments, we demonstrated that the inter-GPU communication and data exchange drastically afect the running time of the join algorithms.



# [Counting frequent patterns in large labeled graphs: a hypergraph-based approach](/files/DrTuPaper2.pdf)
We propose a new framework for studying support measures in frequent subgraph mining. This framework transforms pattern and data graph into hypergraphs containing occurrences and instances of the pattern as well as information of the original graph, in contrast to existing overlap graph techniques that only contain the former.
